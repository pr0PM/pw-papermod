Hi! I'm Prateek Mishra, I go around the internet by the username `pr0PM`. 

Currently I work with the Cloud Team at [Founda Health](https://foundahealth.com/) since January 2026.

Earlier, I've spent last 5y with the Cloud & Security team at [Atlan](https://atlan.com), progressing from intern to SDE-II.

Fastest way to reach me: [Telegram](https://t.me/pr0PM).

I'm passionate about empowering students and hobbyists with practical tech skills. I mentor and guide them around tools like a.i agents, linux, git, docker, and kubernetes.

Away from the keyboard I ride my bike around [Lucknow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow), read non‑fiction, watch anime, enjoy online games and a fellow r/selfhost.

If you'd like to collaborate, invite me to speak, or have questions, feel free to reach out [here](https://pr0pm.in/links/)
