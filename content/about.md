- Hi — I'm Prateek Mishra (pr0PM). I joined the Cloud Team at [Founda Health](https://foundahealth.com/) in January 2026, after nearly five years on the Cloud & Security team at [Atlan](https://twitter.com/AtlanHQ), where I progressed from intern to SDE‑II.

Fastest way to reach me: [Telegram](https://t.me/pr0PM). I also share links and notes on my channel: [https://t.me/pr0PMs](https://t.me/pr0PMs).

I'm passionate about empowering students and hobbyists with practical tech skills. I mentor and teach tools such as Git, Docker, and Kubernetes, and I enjoy self‑hosting projects on single‑board computers.

Away from the keyboard I ride my bike around [Lucknow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow), read non‑fiction, watch anime, and game.

If you'd like to collaborate, invite me to speak, or have a question, ping me on [Telegram](https://t.me/pr0PM).

**What I write about**
- DevOps best practices and practical workflows.
- Implementing SRE practices to improve reliability.
- Multi‑cloud architectures (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Linux (daily driver) and self‑hosting on SBCs.
- DevOps best practices and how they can streamline your development process.
- Implementing SRE practices in an organization to make a real difference.
- Cloud computing across the top three public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Linux as my daily driver OS (always up for distro wars!).
