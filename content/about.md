Hi, I'm Prateek Mishra, I go around the internet by the username `pr0PM`.

I work with the Cloud and Security Team @ [AtlanHQ](https://twitter.com/AtlanHQ/) as SDE-II.

At Atlan I have built and managed stuff around cloud native technologies and scaled them for hundreds of K8S clusters, touching on things starting from CI/CD to observability and from being on call to adding customer value.

Currently, I'm focusing more on learning and implementing best practices for cloud security and networking around K8S and AWS, Azure and GCP while implementing stuff with GitOps wherever possible.

I'm passionate about empowering students with tech. I actively engage with local tech and student communities, bridging the gap between academia and industry by introducing university students to essential tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes and self hosting. As a self-hosting enthusiast, I'm always eager to connect with fellow self hosters.

To decouple myself from the screen, I'm either working out or riding my bike/bicycle around the beautiful city of Lucknow or reading random finance, business and electronics magazines or just watching anime.

Iâ€™m still not an expert at any of these but have a working experience around the following concepts on production environments.

So from my technical experience we can talk about some DevOps best practices, implementing SRE practices in an organization and actually getting value out of it, Cloud computing with the top three public cloud providers, Linux as a daily driver OS (distrowars) and self hosting stuff on SBCs.

In case you want to reach out, I will respond fastest via [Telegram](https://t.me/pr0PM) and [here](https://t.me/pr0PMs) is the link to my Telegram channel which is a place where I post things I liked on the internet and might be worth your time.
