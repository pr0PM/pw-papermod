Hi, I'm Prateek Mishra, I go around the internet by the username `pr0PM`.

I work with the Cloud and Security Team @ [AtlanHQ](https://twitter.com/AtlanHQ/) as SDE-II.

At Atlan I have built and managed stuff around cloud native technologies and scaled them for hundreds of K8S clusters, touching on things starting from CI/CD to observability and from being on call to adding customer value.

I'm currently dedicated to enhancing my skills in cloud security and networking, specifically within the Kubernetes ecosystem and major cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP. My goal is to implement industry best practices to ensure robust and secure cloud infrastructure.

I'm passionate about empowering students with tech. I actively engage with local tech and student communities, bridging the gap between academia and industry by introducing university students to essential tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes and self hosting. As a self-hosting enthusiast, I'm always eager to connect with fellow self hosters.

To decouple myself from the screen, I'm either working out or riding my bike/bicycle around the beautiful city of Lucknow or reading random finance, business and electronics magazines or just watching anime.

I'm constantly tinkering with tech and picking up new skills. While I wouldn't call myself a master of any of these yet, I've gained valuable experience working with various tools and concepts in production environments.
This experience fuels my passion for discussing topics like:
- DevOps best practices and how they can streamline your development process.
- Implementing SRE practices in an organization to make a real difference.
- Cloud computing across the top three public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Linux as my daily driver OS (always up for distro wars!).
- The joys and challenges of self-hosting on Single Board Computers (SBCs).

In case you want to reach out, I will respond fastest via [Telegram](https://t.me/pr0PM) and [here](https://t.me/pr0PMs) is the link to my Telegram channel which is a place where I post things I liked on the internet and might be worth your time.
